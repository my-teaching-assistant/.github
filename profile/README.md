# Welcome to my-ta

my-ta is a cutting-edge platform dedicated to delivering generative AI to students in universities and colleges. Our mission is to enhance the educational experience by providing personalized, AI-driven teaching assistants tailored to each course's specific needs.

## About Us
At my-ta, we empower professors to create custom teaching assistants that have direct access to their course content and a repository of common student questions. This allows students to engage in natural, conversational interactions with the AI, similar to the experience of using Q&A forums like Piazza.

## Key Features
- **Personalized AI Teaching Assistants**: Professors can set up AI TAs that are knowledgeable about their specific course materials.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Students can ask questions and receive detailed answers, mimicking the dynamic of classroom interactions and online forums.
- **Course-Specific Knowledge**: The AI has access to course content and frequently asked questions, ensuring relevant and accurate assistance.

## Our Vision
We aim to bridge the gap between traditional teaching methods and modern technology, providing a seamless, interactive, and supportive learning environment for students. By leveraging the power of generative AI, my-ta helps to enhance understanding, improve accessibility, and foster a more engaging educational experience.
